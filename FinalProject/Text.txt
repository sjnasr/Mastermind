Player 1 picks a random 4 letter word.
● Player 2 then chooses 4 letters from the English alphabet and arranges them in a
particular order. This is Player 2’s proposal.
● Player 1 considers the proposal and responds as follows using a 4 symbol code:
○ For each letter of the proposal that is correct AND is in the right location,
the code contains an asterisk (not necessarily in the same location of the
correct letter).
○ For each letter of the proposal that is correct but is in the wrong location,
the code contains a hyphen.
○ For each letter of the proposal that is not correct the code would contain a
blank.
○ The code is constructed by putting all the asterisks first, then the dashes
and finally the spaces (except that the response would say NO CORRECT
LETTERS, or something equivalent, instead of all blanks).
● Game play proceeds in a cycle by repeating proposals and code responses until
Player 2 guesses the word correctly (4 stars) or gives up :-(
Obviously, it’s far easier to make the computer play the part of Player 1. So that’s what
you need to do. Write a program that would play Mastermind in the role of Player 1 (with
the user in the role of Player 2).
